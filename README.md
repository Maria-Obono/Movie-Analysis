# Movie-Analysis

Analyze a movie rating dataset. The data is stored in a CSV file (either use the one in the repository or download the latest from Kaggle). You need to read this file into spark and calculate the mean rating and standard deviation for all movies. There is no test case provided for you, so you need to write your own test cases to ensure that at least your program works well.

I got my csv file (ratings_small.csv) from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

I had to use ratings_small.csv instead of ratings.csv because of the file size. By using ratings.csv, the file was not uploadable on github.
